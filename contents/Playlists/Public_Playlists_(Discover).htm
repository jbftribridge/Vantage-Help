  <h1>Public Playlists (Discover)</h1>
  <p><span>Playlists allow authors to easily share their knowledge with learners in a collection format. <span>Learners can subscribe to playlists created by other users, whether they are peers, leaders, or subject matter experts, and use the suggested training in playlists to develop their own careers.</span></span></p>
  <p><b>Note:</b><span><span> </span>The<span> Public </span></span><span>toggle must be ON in order for playlists to be searchable and visible to other users.</span></p>
