Admins can also first click on any individual playlist to open a modal to get more details about it before acting.  From within this modal they can see the playlist’s description, a list of learning objects within the playlist, author name, territory, and # of subscribers. </p><p class="body"><img src="../../assets/images/Experience Hub_Release Notes R2.5 v1.0 DRAFT (1)_files/image4.png" width="672.0" height="326.9" alt="Picture 20"/></p><p class="body">Clicking the ‘Reassign’ button will open an initial modal to search for a new owner.

The previous owner will no longer see the playlist on their “Your playlists” page.</p><p class="body">Clicking the ‘Make private’ button will open a modal making sure the admin is certain that they want to complete the action of changing the playlist from public to private.  Once changed the playlist will no longer show in the list.  Owners will be notified by an in-app notification that their playlist has been made private. </p><p class="body"><img src="../../assets/images/Experience Hub_Release Notes R2.5 v1.0 DRAFT (1)_files/image7.png" width="275.2" height="112.0" alt="Picture 29"/></p><p class="body">Subscribers will maintain access to playlists that have been made private by the admin.

Twenty-four (24) will display by default, with subsequent loaded when triggered by infinite scroll. We have also added a filter drawer to both “Your playlists” and “Subscribed playlists” and will allow for search by title.  The filter drawer will default to open to large screens and to closed for anything smaller. The original default to sorting by title A-Z has been updated to Latest Activity new to old.  Along with this change a sort by for both “Latest activity” and “Title” has been added.</p><p class="body"><img src="../../assets/images/Experience Hub_Release Notes R2.5 v1.0 DRAFT (1)_files/image9.png" width="672.0" height="315.7" alt="Picture 28"/></p></div></body></html>
