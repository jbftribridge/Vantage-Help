    <p class="body">A new media player has been integrated into ExperienceHub for Video and Audio content in order to support security enhancements implemented within the release. The player supports picture-in-picture so that users can experience the content while also viewing other on-screen material. The new player also supports copyrighted material by preventing the content from being downloaded. There is no expected change to xAPI behavior.</p>
